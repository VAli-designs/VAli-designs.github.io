What is UX Research&nbsp;?</strong></span></h2><h3><strong>a User Research and UX Research definition</strong></h3><p>User Research or UX Research is an area <strong>which aims to understand the expectations of users of a product or service</strong> through the whole touchpoints.</p><p><br><strong>User Research </strong>is supposed to be more focused on Users when <strong>UX Research</strong> or <strong>User Experience Research </strong>is supposed to<strong> </strong>be more focused on the experience of the users, his/her, its interactions with the service, product, shop... <strong>the touchpoints.</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>At AllAboutUsers we do both, the focus depends on the project and the team's questions and needs.&nbsp;<br>Simply sometimes, it is both.<br><strong>Touchpoints</strong> are the <strong>point of contact between your service/product/brand and your users</strong>. They can be mobile/desktop app, website, physical stores, brand image and graphic visuals, product or even packaging.</p><p>User Research uses different methods which aim to study the uses and needs of users/customers in order to make better strategic, business decisions for a brand or a company. User research techniques come <strong>mainly from the cognitive and human sciences.</strong></p><h3><strong>At what point should UX Research to be&nbsp;done?</strong></h3><ul><li>At the beginning of the project</li><li>When designing the interface, or building the service/the product</li><li>When the project is already in shape: product, interfaces (mobile, desktop, application, eshop, store)</li></ul><h3><strong>What about the Frequency&nbsp;?</strong></h3><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:44.46%;\"><img src=\"/images/clock.jpg\" alt=\" Photographer Loic Djim\"><figcaption>Photographer Loic Djim</figcaption></figure><p>UX Research are <strong>important at every stage</strong>. They can be launched <strong>once or as a strategy at different </strong>moments of the brand/company/product life.</p><p>For instance, some of our customers launch User Testing sessions every year.&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"color:hsl(30,75%,60%);\"><strong>2. What about the User Research&nbsp;methods?</strong></span></h2><h3><strong>A customized method</strong></h3><p>The UX Research methods must be <strong>customized according to the project, the goals, the users and the needs</strong>.</p><p>At allaboutusers, we discuss a lot with our clients about their needs, their objectives, the story behind their brand or company. We care about <strong>proposing the most appropriated method</strong> to have the <strong>best results</strong>.</p><p>Some part of UX Research process, we use at AllAboutUsers:</p><ul><li>Observation, Interviews</li><li>Shadowing</li><li>User Testing</li><li>Focus group</li><li>UX competitor study or UX Benchmark</li><li>Website/App Metrics analysis, Hotjar, Data: Clickstream/Click Path</li><li>Online survey</li><li>Card Sorting</li><li>And many more&nbsp;!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"color:hsl(30,75%,60%);\"><strong>3.

An example with one of our client's feedback</strong></span></h2><p>For instance, one of our <strong>customers launched his brand on the french market</strong> a few month before we got in touch. Sales were not as good as expected and he wanted to have a better understanding of his/her customers needs/behavior in France (UK brand).&nbsp;</p><p>We <strong>launched a UX Research study</strong> and <strong>discovered that some points</strong> (words, Presentation on the website, lack of explanation in the buying process, misunderstanding…) <strong>were disturbing for the customers. Those points could stop the buying process</strong> and <strong>bring a mistaken image of the product and the brand</strong> pushing the customers to <strong>look for a competitor</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to the study, we were able to <strong>provide our client real and effective tools</strong> to help him fulfill his goals based on real feedback and real needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><strong>In conclusion</strong></h3><p>We hope this article helped you to have a better understanding of User Research and how it can improve your product lifecycle and help you to create a better service for your customers.&nbsp;</p><p>If you still have questions or just want to discuss, don’t hesitate to contact us.&nbsp;<br>As we are social, you can reach us on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/allaboutusersfr\">Linkedin</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAboutUsersfr\">Twitter</a> and follow us for news update.</p><p>Interested to see some example of our work, our UX Research methods applied?&nbsp;<br><a href=\"https://www.allaboutusers.fr/ux-studies\">Watch these UX Studies</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p>"}},"pageContext":{"sourcePath":"/Users/fdecampredon/workspaces/site-vanessa/content/blog/all-about-ux-research.md"}}}
