    You will be able to watch the full session: 


    * the participant's face and reactions

    * the user's screen and mouse click via a remote screen display


    ### Test room


    Following your needs, the sessions are moderated. 


    The sessions are recorded (audio + video + webcam + Mouse click) even on mobile devices.
